00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,390
Hey, welcome back to 100 Days of Code.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:11,090
This is Angela from the App Brewery, and today is day 15 where we're going to set up our local development

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,780
environment for Python and we're going to be building a Coffee Machine project.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,850
So when we designed the course,

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,390
we really wanted you to get up and running as fast as possible and start coding straight away.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,150
But as our project gets more and more complex, then it's really important to start thinking about setting

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,250
up a proper development environment.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,760
Now, if you were a chef, then you need really sharp knives. And as a programmer, you need a good development

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,440
environment.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,680
In today's lesson, I'm going to show you how to set up my favorite IDE,

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,000
and the IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,430
This is a piece of software that will help you as you're creating your code,

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,550
and it's going to do a whole bunch of things for you including things like linting your code, finding

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,270
errors in it, giving you guidance on your coding style, helping you debug issues, just making life

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,630
easier for you as you start writing more and more code.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,120
This is the moment where you're graduating from a newbie developer.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,280
It's like as if you've gone into the mountains, you've fetched water for this old sensei for like 20

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,310
years and finally he's going to show you how to use a sword.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,030
This is going to be the equivalent of our sword.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,400
Now, in terms of development environment, there's actually a whole bunch to choose from.

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,340
And you might have heard of some of these like Jupiter or Spider,

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,640
VS

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,200
Code and some of them we've already used like Thonny.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,910
But the one that we're going to use is something called PyCharm.

25
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,510
And this is an Intelligent Development Environment, an IDE, that is specialized for Python.

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,590
The tool has been sharpened especially for python coding, and it's what the professionals use. In

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,520
the coming lessons,

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,860
we're going to get really familiar with this tool.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,390
And gradually, I want to show you how it can help you become a better and more productive developer.

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,820
But before we can get started installing PyCharm, we first have to get the latest version of Python

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,220
installed on your computer.

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,110
In the course resources, you can go ahead and find the download link for Python. Then once you're

33
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,230
there, it should automatically detect your current operating system.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:36,840
So here I am on Windows and it says download the latest version for Windows. And then if you click on

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,250
the big download button, it'll ensure that you get the latest version of Python.

36
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,260
Now, it's actually a very small file, so it shouldn't take very long to download.

37
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,510
And once it's complete, go ahead and open up that .exe file.

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,760
Now, go ahead and make sure that the checkbox for Add Python 3.8 to Path is checked and

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,890
then leave everything else as it is

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,740
and click on Install now. And make sure that you have admin privileges while you're installing

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,870
so you have to be logged on as the administrator. And say yes to any of the prompts.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,590
Now, installation should only take a few minutes. And once it's done, you might get a hint here saying

43
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,260
"Disable path length limit."

44
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,710
If you see that, then go ahead and click on it.

45
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:37,610
And again, say yes for allow. And then you're done and you can close off the wizard. If you're on a Mac,

46
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,840
the process is virtually identical.

47
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,860
Once you head over to the link from the course resources, you should see it automatically, let's you download

48
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,330
the latest version for Mac.

49
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,520
And once the download is complete, you can go through the wizard clicking

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,280
continue agreeing to everything that they ask you to agree and click install.

51
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,200
And again, you'll need to be on the administrator account and type in your password to allow Python

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,430
to be installed on your computer. Once installation is completed, it should open up this folder and

53
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,100
you should see Python 3.8 or a later version like 3.9 or 3.10.

54
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,250
But as long as you see this, then you've been successful and you can delete the installer from your

55
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,890
computer.

56
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,990
So now you should have successfully installed Python onto your computer, and we're ready to proceed to

57
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,050
the next step. Head over to the next lesson

58
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,330
and we're going to download and install ПайЧарм.
