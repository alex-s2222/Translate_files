00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,930
In this video,

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,100
I'm going to walk through the process to install PyCharm on Mac. Now,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,880
if you're on a Windows computer and you've already installed PyCharm,

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,290
then you can skip this video.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,860
So you should have now downloaded the PyCharm installer.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,820
So go ahead and open up the DMG file. Now,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,680
when you see this window, drag the icon for PyCharm into the applications

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,730
folder. And now you can go to spotlight and search for PyCharm.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,930
Then go ahead and click on it to open it up. Now,

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,960
make sure that you have admin privileges and go ahead and say open. And then

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,680
agree to the privacy policy and decide if you want to share data with them or

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,310
not. Now you can select never used 

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,410
PyCharm and click next.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,480
Then you can pick between dark theme or light theme and click next.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,160
And then go ahead and click on skip remaining and set defaults.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,860
Now we can go ahead and create our first project in PyCharm.

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,620
Name your project whatever you want,

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,070
but it's really important that you click on this drop-down to check that your

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,140
project interpreter, and especially the base interpreter, is set to the latest

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,820
version of Python that you installed, which in my case is Python 3.8.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,750
Now, if you're running on a Mac or a Linux,

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,200
you might see several versions of Python in that dropdown list.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,670
So make sure that you select the latest version that you installed and then

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,810
click next. Once it has configured and created your new project,

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,310
this is what you should see.

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,600
And now you're going to go into your project folder, right-click on it,

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,130
and then go to new -> file. Now on a Mac, right

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,800
click is also the same as control clicking.

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,120
So you could hold down the control key and then click on the project folder.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,610
And again, choose new, and then file.

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,500
And the file we're going to create is going to be our main.py. Now,

32
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,760
inside here, all that we're going to do is just print hello world.

33
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,680
And we're going to run this code and make sure that it works.

34
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,010
So go to run and then click on this run button and select the main Python file

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,280
as the one you want to run and then down here, you should see the run tab

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,690
pop up all of a sudden,

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,400
and you should see your hello world printed in the console.

38
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,690
And then it'll say process finished with exit code zero,

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,700
zero is a success,

40
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,380
and that means you're now all set up and you're ready to start using PyCharm

41
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,680
as if it were any other Python editor.

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,760
So anything that you've done in Repl.it you can now do in PyCharm.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,650
You can create new files, you can write the files and you can run those files.
