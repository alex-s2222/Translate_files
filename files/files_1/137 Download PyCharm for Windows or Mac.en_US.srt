1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,440
So you should have now successfully installed Python onto your computer,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,870
and we're ready to proceed to the next step,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,220
which is to download PyCharm. Again, in the course resources,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,140
you'll find a link to the home page to download PyCharm.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,480
And once you get to this page,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,510
you should click on the download button and this takes you to the options page.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,210
Now, here, it should automatically select your system.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,760
So currently I'm on a Windows computer,

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,090
and it's automatically selected the Windows tab.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,960
And you can click on the system requirements to make sure that your computer is

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,760
compatible. And you can also take a look at the installation instructions,

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
which is pretty simple. It's basically download and run.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,490
So there's two versions of PyCharm;

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,830
the professional and the community version.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,760
You're going to select the community version because it's completely free and

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,870
open source to use.

17
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,680
The professional version has a free trial and after that you'll have to pay for

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,880
it, but the community version already has all of the features that we need

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,200
and more. Once you click on download, that will take a little while,

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,970
anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes. So while you're waiting for that to run,

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,920
you can head over to the next lesson

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,490
and I'll talk about some of the features of PyCharm that we can look forward

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,230
to. Now, if you are on a Mac, the process is pretty much the same.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,380
So head over to the link that's in the course resources,

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,540
click on download and download the community version of PyCharm.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,920
Now, if you're a Linux user, you can also toggle to the Linux tab.

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,270
And while your here,

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,720
you can look at the system requirements and the installation instructions.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,310
Once you are ready, go ahead and click on the download button for the community

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,630
edition, which is free and open-source, and then download will begin.

31
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,140
And again, it'll take anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,310
So let it download and head over to the next lesson where I want to show you

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,260
some of the great features of PyCharm.
