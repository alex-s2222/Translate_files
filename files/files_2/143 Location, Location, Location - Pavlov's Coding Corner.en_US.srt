00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,220
Well done for completing day 15.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,620
You're doing really, really well.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:15,070
Now, today, I got another study tip for you and the study tip relates to where you study. Because

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:22,180
what I find is that when I mix the area where I have all my entertainment, where I watch Netflix,

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:29,590
where I eat or where I have fun with the place where I study, then I can start to get a bit confused

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,120
and my brain is like, "Hey, wait a minute. We used to watch Netflix here.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,700
Now why are we doing this really hard thing?

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,100
I just want to go back to that Netflix watching and maybe some popcorn."

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:48,700
So what you can do is define a study area, find a little nook and cranny, go under the stairs if you

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,270
have to.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,960
Just make sure that you only study in that one place and you don't do anything else. That way

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,790
every time you enter that space, it'll feel like, "Oh, I know. I know what I have to do here.

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,900
I have to study."

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,310
And this is one tip that's really helped me beat procrastination.

15
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,050
So I hope you'll try it out too.
